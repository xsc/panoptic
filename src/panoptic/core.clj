(defn run!
  "Run the given Watcher. An optional vector of initial entities to watch can be
   specified, followed by the following options:
  
   - `:interval`: the base interval to use for the polling threads,
   - `:threads`: the number of watcher threads to create,
   - `:distribute`: the distribution strategy to use with multiple threads.

  Examples:

     (run! watcher)
     (run! watcher [\"file.txt\"])
     (run! watcher :interval 200)
     (run! watcher [\"file.txt\"] :threads 4)

  This returns a watch runner stoppable by `stop!` or `stop-watcher!`.
