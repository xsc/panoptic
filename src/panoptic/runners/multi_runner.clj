;; ## Concept
;;
;; In addition to watcher and handler threads the multi-threaded runner uses a scheduling/
;; distribution thread to move entities between watchers and to handle added/removed entities.
;; The distribution strategy can be user-defined, e.g.:
;;
;; - let multiple threads watch all entities simulateneously (same as multiple simple watchers);
;; - let multiple threads watch equally big portions of the entity pool;
;; - let threads watch entities by change frequency (e.g. more changes mean more checking);
;; - ...
;;
;; Redistribution can happen periodically.
