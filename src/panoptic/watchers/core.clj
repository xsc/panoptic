;; ## Protocol for WatchFn

    "Wrap a WatchFn's entity handler function using the given one.")
  (wrap-watch-fn [this f]
    "Wrap a WatchFn's update function using the given one."))

;; ## Watch Logic
;;
;; The watcher logic consists of a map of:
;; - `:update-fn`: a function that takes an entity, performs checks, updates, ...
;;   and returns the updated entity
;; - `:add-fn`: a function that takes a map and an entity description (e.g. a
;;   file path) and returns a new map with the additional entities.
;; - `:remove-fn`: a function that takes a map and an entity description and returns
;;   a new map without the desired entities.
;; - `:handle-fn`: a function that takes an entity and performs any tasks changes to
;;   the entity require
;;
